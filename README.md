# Bookme

This project is about building a facilities booking app, at the begining, this would be a booking app for DCU students, so that they can book the quietpods or lab rooms or classrooms. It also aims to provide tools for students and for businesses. The first tool we want to have is a color scheme, finding the right color scheme is especially important for marketing and building an optimal frontend ui design.

<!-- # CA472 template repo

This is a template for CA472 projects.

## 1. Create your repo

One person from your project team should fork this repo, then add other teammates as project members on GitLab.

## 2. Name your repo appropriately

The name of your project repo must be of the form `2023-ca472-XXXXXXX`, where "`XXXXXXX`"
should be replaced with your usernames (e.g. `2023-ca472-sblott-pclarke`).

It is the *name of your repo* which matters (not the name of your project).

You can change the name of your repo on GitLab under:

- Settings / General / Advanced / Change path

It looks like this:

![change-repo-path](./res/repo-change-path2023.png "Change repo path.")

After you have read this file, you
should replace all of this content with a README describing your own project. -->
